Getting the hash value through multiplicative hashing works.
Hash table doubles when load factor is greater than or equal to .75.
The hash table doubles when it's reallocating, and it also will check
if the new hash table size is a prime number and if it isn't it will find
the closest prime number that is greater than the doubled hash table size.

The arguments to run the program after compliling it with a makefile is

UIMS inputFile1 inputFile2 ...

if no input file is found, then it will let you type in names manually, and 
after each name you type you would press the return key and type the next name.
When you want to see the completed hash table, just press ctrl d after 
manually inserting.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
After running UIMS with an input file, press ctrl d to print the hashtable, 
because it will allow you to type in more names after all the names from
the input file are put in the table.
